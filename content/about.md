       Hi, my name's Kevin. I've been a Software Engineer at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory since 2017, working mainly on missions to Mars (Mars 2020 and MSL) and the Planetary Data System. I'm passionate about open-source software, cloud computing, space, and coffee.

Hobbies include skiing, board games, and playing with my psycho dog.
