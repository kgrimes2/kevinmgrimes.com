I'm a huge fan of the [Zenburn theme](https://kippura.org/zenburnpage/), which is a low-contrast color scheme originally created for vim. It's nice on the eyes regardless of whether you're working early in the morning or late at night.

There's Zenburn themes for most text editors ([emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs), [vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanolsonx.zenburn)), terminal clients ([iterm2](https://github.com/colinta/zenburn)), and even web browsers ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenburningchrome-theme/hakjkjcbffhnjeghcfdckehklpeifoma)), but I wasn't able to find anything online that mapped this color pallete to a Slack theme.

*Until now.*

Here's a screenshot:

And another with light theme:

Here's the hex codes if you'd like to configure your client to use these colors:

```
#6F6F6F,#121212,#5F7F5F,#FFFFFF,#8CB0D3,#FBFFF0,#71D3B4,#CC9393,#FFCFAF,#1F1F1F
```

When you're done, the settings screen should look like this:
